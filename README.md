# FRAPApp
MATLAB code from a summer project I did as an undergraduate.
This is meant to be a fully developed program with a GUI which analyses Floruence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)
video footage and analysing it by detecting regions where the cell is flurocessing (usualy corrosponding to a nucleus) 
and then calculates diffusion constants for the molecule the flurocent tag is attatched to by fitting a functional form
to the rate of decay of light being emitted.
